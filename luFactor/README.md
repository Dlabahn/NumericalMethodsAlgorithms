# LuFactor
The LuFactor algorithm is designed to solve systems of equations using gauss elimination while utilizing partial pivoting. This algorithm will output the upper, lower and pivoted identity matrix for any number of variables provided an equal number of equations in matrix form. These outputs can be used to solve any given system of equations where number of variables is equal to the number of constraints.
## Inputs
1. A = square matrix of equation coefficients
## Outputs
1. L = lower triangular matrix
2. U = Upper triangular matrix
3. P = pivoted identity matrix
