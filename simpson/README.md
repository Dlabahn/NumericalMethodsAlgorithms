# Simpson
The Simpson algorithm is a method to determine the approximate integral of an unlimited set of data points using Simpson's 1/3 rule where possible. If necessary the trapezoidal rule is used for the final data interval. This algorithm could be updated in the future to include Simpson's 3/8 rule to eliminate the need for the trapezoidal rule which would increase the accuracy of the algorithm.
